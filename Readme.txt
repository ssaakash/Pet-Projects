Just tried my hands on creating a few standalone basic games using python. You can either run it using Source codes or using the standalone executable versions.
To run the standalone versions, follow the instructions below.
Instructions:
1. Download the zip file
2. Extract contents
3. Run the .exe file that has the same name as zip file
